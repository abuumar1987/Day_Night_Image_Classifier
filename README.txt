# Day-Night-image-Classifier
The repository contains the code for classifying day and night images using Python and its different libs(NumPy, OpenCV
Matplotlib).
In this project, the dataset consists of 200 colored day/night images in equal quantities: 100 day images and another 100
night images.
Through this program, we attempted to label these day/night photos as day or night images.
Note: these images are open-sourced material(Archive of Many Outdoor Scene)
